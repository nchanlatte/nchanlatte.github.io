                <h3>Hiroshima, Japan</h3>
                <p>
                  In 2017 I spent 10 days with 3 people in Japan. In that time
                  we visited Toykyo, Hiroshima and Kyoto, staying in hostels
                  through hostelworld.com. We made our way around biking, taking
                  the subway, and relaxing on Japan Rail. I would without a
                  doubt return to Japan especially Hiroshima.

                <p>
                  During my time at Creighton I had the opportinity to travel to
                  5 countries with my classmates. Three of the five was with
                  Model United Nations (by far the best club out there). My
                  senior year we went to Rome where we had an audience with the
                  Pope, went to dinner with Foriegn Service Embassadors for the
                  Vatican and enjoyed amazing italian cuisine.

                <h3>Nagaland, India</h3>
                <p>
                  While the picture above was a day trip to the the Taj Mahal,
                  my favorite city in India was Nagaland. I spent a month in the
                  northeast at a Jesuit school helping teach English and basic
                  techonoligy to students. Being in Nagaland and with the
                  Jesuits humbled me and taught me the power of knoweldge.
                  Through that experience I am continusly reminded and inspired
                  to continue to give back to the community, stay educated, and
                  never take what I have for granted.

                <h3>Barcelona, Spain</h3>
                <p>
                  The food, culture, and architecture in Barcelona floored me.
                  While I believe every city has its own beauty, I fell in love
                  with Barcelona. The history of and design of all of Gaudi's
                  buildings were impressive. The amount of time that it has
                  taken to build and fund La Sagrada Familia church was
                  unbeliveable. This colorful and vibrant city has to say the
                  least left an unforgettable impact on me.

                <h3>Seoul, South Korea</h3>
                <p>
                  Fast internet, spotless subways and korean bbq. Each asian
                  culture I've visited is so unqiue compared to anything I've
                  experienced. Korea was such a friendly, clean and
                  technologically advanced country. What draws my attention the
                  most is how peaceful the country is with the constant threat
                  of North Korea. The picture above is a train station the
                  Koreans made for when the two countries declare peace. This
                  station holds no trains but is a symbolic place for both
                  sides. While the South Koreans are prepared for anything, they
                  live their day with a smile on thier face.

                <p>
                  My new home since 2017! I've always loved visiting NY and was
                  excited to make the move out here. Everyday is a new adventure
                  with challenages and rewards. I love the diversity,
                  independance, constant change and tranquility of New York. I
                  have yet to find a city quite like it.
