                <p>
                  In 2017 I went to Japan with a group of friends. We stopped in Tokyo, Hiroshima and Kyoto,
                  staying in cozy hostels and biking around. Every momement of the trip was breathtaking. 
                  I would return without a doubt to Japan especially Hiroshima.

                <p>
                  During my time at Creighton I had the opportinity to travel to
                  5 countries with Model United Nations (by far the best club out there). My
                  senior year we went to Rome where we had an audience with the
                  Pope, went to dinner with Foriegn Service Embassadors for the
                  Vatican and enjoyed amazing italian cuisine.

                <h3>Nagaland, India</h3>
                <p>
                  I spent a month in northeast India at a Jesuit school helping teach English and basic
                  techonoligy to students. Being in Nagaland and with the
                  Jesuits humbled me and taught me the power of knoweldge.
                  That experience continusly reminds and inspires me
                  to continue to give back to the community, stay educated, and
                  never take what I have for granted.

                <p>
                  I fell in love with Barcelona's food, culture and architecture. The history and design of all of Gaudi's
                  buildings were impressive. I am still in shock at how much time it has
                  taken to build and fund La Sagrada Familia church. Like the others on my list, this colorful and vibrant city has to say the
                  has left an unforgettable impact on me.

                <p>
                  Fast internet, spotless subways and korean bbq. Each asian
                  culture I've visited is so unique compared to anything I've
                  experienced. South Korea was a friendly, clean and
                  technology advanced country. The city was surprisingly peaceful. 
                  The picture above was a train station at the DMZ that the
                  Koreans made for when the two countries declare peace. There are no actual trains but is a symbolic 
                  place for both sides. While the South Koreans are prepared for anything, they
                  live their day with a smile on thier face.

                <p>
                  New York has been my new home since 2017! I've always loved visiting the city and was
                  excited to make the move out here. Everyday is a new adventure
                  with challenges and rewards. I thrive on the diversity,
                  independance, constant change and tranquility of New York. I
                  have yet to find a city quite like it.
